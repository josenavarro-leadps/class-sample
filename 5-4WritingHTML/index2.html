		<h1>1. Lionel Messi</h1>
		<p>The number one soccer player right now is the star of FC Barcelona, winner of 5 balones d'Or: Lionel Messi. Messi started playing in a professional team at the age of 14. His first team was named Newells Old Boys in the Argentine league. Sadly the star of Barcelona was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency in his child hood. But obviously that did not stop him from breaking records and becoming the best player the world has ever seen. </p>

		<h2>2. Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
		<p>The second best soccer player in the world is the Portugese Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo has been known for his amazing skills and awesome foul kicks. Eventhough Ronaldo doesnt shine much with the Portugese team he makes soccer look easy when he is with Real Madrid. Ronaldo has broken records and set new ones and is only goals away from winning more trophies.</p>
